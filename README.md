# Arduino Scheduler
Arduino Scheduler allows you run many tasks, with delay without locking the processor.

The standart arduino Scheduler Library, only works with the Arduino Due board.
This library works in all arduino boards.

# Simple test
To see this in action, copy the main.cpp file in examples path to the root path.
Now, execute the makefile using the make command.
This will be create an executable binary file called "scheduler".

    make
    ./scheduler

or
